Next steps for you [to get the email working]:

Provide a real SendGrid API key and from-address via firebase functions:config:set sendgrid.key="YOUR_KEY" sendgrid.from="Arcade Earth Crew <crew@arcade.earth>".
Deploy both functions (firebase deploy --only functions).
Once you’re ready, set up the service-account credentials and Sheet ID configs if you haven’t yet so both the email and sheet mirror run in production.



Setup Risks

firebase.json:22-32 still declares the default codebase as python313, but the deployed logic lives in functions/index.js:1-113 and depends on Node-only packages. Today, a deploy will spin up a Python runtime that never loads your SendGrid/Sheets handlers. Switch the runtime to nodejs20 (or split the JS into its own codebase) and prune the unused Python scaffold in functions/main.py:1-21 to avoid confusion.
Secrets such as the Sheets service account and SendGrid keys are being read from plain env vars in functions/index.js:6-30. Consider migrating them to firebase functions:secrets:set (or functions.config().set) so you aren’t copying private keys into local files for every collaborator.
Maintainability

The legal copy is duplicated between src/legal/terms.html:1 (bundled into the modal) and the static fallback at public/legal/terms.html:1. They’re already diverging in markup and will drift over time; extract a single source (e.g., move the shared HTML to src/legal and generate the public version during build) so edits aren’t doubled.
package.json:22-25 pulls googleapis into the Vite app even though that library is only needed server-side. Keeping it in the front-end dependencies bloats install size and risks accidental bundling; rely on the copy already listed in functions/package.json.
src/lib/firebase.js:5-33 signals required VITE_FIREBASE_* vars, but there’s no .env.example checked in. Adding one keeps teammates from guessing which keys they need.
Polish

src/ui/footerOther.js:29-33 declares discoTimer but never uses it, which reads like a forgotten cleanup job. Drop the variable or wire it up to make the intent clear.
Both modal controllers (src/ui/quizModal.js and src/ui/thumbModal.js) carry near-identical focus-trap/history logic. A small shared helper would cut future bug fixes in half.
