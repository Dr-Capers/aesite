        <h3>Privacy policy</h3>
        <p>We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this privacy policy (“Policy”). This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide (“Personal Information”) on the <strong>arcade.earth</strong> website (“Website”), “THUMB-WAR” mobile application (“Mobile Application”), and any of their related products and services (collectively, “Services”), and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that Personal Information.</p>
        <p>This Policy is a legally binding agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and Arcade Earth LLC (doing business as “Planetary Games”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If you are entering into this Policy on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Policy, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer to such entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this Policy, you must not accept this Policy and may not access and use the Services.

        <h4>Collection of personal information</h4>
        <p>You can access and use the Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information by which someone could identify you. If you wish to use certain features, you may be asked to provide Personal Information (for example, name and email address). We collect information you knowingly provide and may gather data from joint partners or social platforms.</p>

        <h4>Privacy of children</h4>
        <p>We take special precautions to protect children under the age of 13. We only request information necessary for the Services and encourage guardians to monitor online activity.</p>

        <h4>Use and processing of collected information</h4>
        <p>We act as a data controller and processor depending on context. Information may be used to manage accounts, deliver updates, respond to inquiries, improve experiences, enforce policies, and operate the Services.</p>

        <h4>Payment processing</h4>
        <p>When payments are required we use PCI-compliant processors. Payment data is shared only to complete transactions, issue refunds, and handle related queries.</p>

        <h4>Disclosure of information</h4>
        <p>We may share data with trusted service providers. We may disclose Personal Information to comply with law, protect rights, or as part of a business transition.</p>

        <h4>Retention of information</h4>
        <p>Personal Information is retained as long as necessary to provide Services, comply with obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce policies. Upon expiration of retention periods, data is deleted or anonymized.</p>

        <h4>Transfer of information</h4>
        <p>Your information may be transferred to servers outside your country. Transfers will include safeguards consistent with applicable law.</p>

        <h4>Region specific notices</h4>
        <p>We provide supplemental notices for residents of Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU/EEA/UK, New Zealand, and several US states outlining rights such as access, correction, deletion, restriction, data portability, complaint procedures, and more.</p>

        <h4>How to exercise your rights</h4>
        <p>Contact us to exercise privacy rights. We may verify identity before responding. Authorized representatives must provide proof of authority.</p>

        <h4>Data analytics</h4>
        <p>We use third-party analytics tools to monitor performance and usage trends.</p>

        <h4>Do not sell my personal information</h4>
        <p>You may opt out of the sale or disclosure of your Personal Information by contacting us.</p>

        <h4>Do Not Track signals</h4>
        <p>Because browsers do not interpret Do Not Track signals uniformly, the Services currently do not respond to them.</p>

        <h4>Advertisements</h4>
        <p>We may display advertisements or allow partners to tailor ads using aggregated, non-identifying information.</p>

        <h4>Social media features</h4>
        <p>The Services may include social media features governed by their providers’ policies.</p>

        <h4>Email marketing</h4>
        <p>You may subscribe to newsletters and can opt out at any time.</p>

        <h4>Push notifications</h4>
        <p>You may opt in to receive push notifications and can disable them in device settings.</p>

        <h4>Links to other resources</h4>
        <p>The Services may contain links to external resources not controlled by us.</p>

        <h4>Information security</h4>
        <p>We implement safeguards to protect Personal Information but cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h4>Data breach</h4>
        <p>If we become aware of a security breach, we will take appropriate measures, including notification when required by law.</p>

        <h4>Changes and amendments</h4>
        <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy at any time. Updated versions are effective upon posting.</p>

        <h4>Acceptance of this policy</h4>
        <p>By accessing and using the Services you agree to this Policy. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to use the Services.</p>

        <h4>Contacting us</h4>
        <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints regarding this Policy, the information we hold about you, or if you wish to exercise your rights, contact <a href="mailto:hello@arcade.earth">hello@arcade.earth</a>.</p>
